# Chelsea are Super Cup champions!

The Blues defeated Villarreal on penalties in Belfast, with **Kepa Arrizabalaga** coming off the bench to save Raul Albiol’s spot-kick and ensure that another European trophy would be heading back to London.

akim Ziyech had earlier netted for Thomas Tuchel’s side, before Gerard Moreno levelled the scores in the second half and after a further 30 minutes of extra-time couldn’t settle the sides, penalties were required.

Cesar Azpilicueta, Marcos Alonso, Mason Mount and Jorginho were the Blues on target and after Kepa saved Albiol’s effort, the celebrations could begin!
